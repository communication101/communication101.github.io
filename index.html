		<p class="myP">The WannaGoFast half-mile event was WILD as usual! A ton of crazy fast passes, unsuspecting cars, spin outs, and some very unique cars this year as well! 
					We are never disappointed when we go to this event! Giddy making a 250mph run on his first pass, a CTS-V going almost 200mph on a wet track, etc. 
					More records are broken every year and we look forward to witness even ore records be broken next year!</p>

		<p class="myP">It’s always CRAZY to witness records be broken! At WannaGoFast this year, we watched this Lambo add on about 2mph to the previous record to become 
					the FASTEST 6-Speed Lamborghini to ever exist! 
					Congrats to the driver and the team for their accomplishment! We are excited to see what they have in store for WannaGoFast next year as well as many others!</p>

		<p class="myP">The CRAZIEST GTR’s We’ve EVER Filmed! It wasn’t easy to make this list as there are SO many WILD moments revolving around any generation of the Nissan GTR! 
					In this video we break down TEN of our Favorite GTR Videos’ we’ve EVER made by breaking down the videos with Fred, the bearded wonder! 
					We cover moments like “How To Drive a 2500hp GTR” with Lucas English to record SHATTERING passes made over the past few years all around the would that have kept 
					the competition FIERCE as teams and drivers fight to achieve the next biggest accomplishment! 
					Leave us your thoughts down below and let us know how our Top 10 list compares to yours!</p>

		<p class="myP">If you saw this car on the street, you would not expect it to have 1500HP! 
					We definitely wouldn’t! Not only is this car a sleeper, it’s basically a frankenstein of mustangs! 
					What started out as a stock 2006 Mustang GT has turned into the monster you see now! The motor is from a Terminator Cobra, 
					the body now resembles a 07-09 GT500, and the interior is from a 11-14 GT500! Very unique build and this thing MOVES! Fastest MPH was 191! 
					We did not expect that when we initially saw this car! Hopefully we see this car out next year at WannaGoFast as well as a ton of others!</p>
